To estimate the market coefficients on three exposures, namely Market Cap, three-year Price Momentum, 
and Market Perception (meastured by 1 over Price), this project performs a Fama-MacBeth type cross-sectional regression and 
compares the results with a pooled regression with robust standard errors.
